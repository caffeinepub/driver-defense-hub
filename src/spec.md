# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a pricing plans interface with static PIX QR code payment option.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a pricing plans page displaying subscription tiers (Basic, Premium, etc.) with visual cards showing price, benefits, and feature lists
- Display a static PIX QR code image for payment using the email key 'proj.defdriver+pagbank@gmail.com'
- Add payment instructions in Portuguese explaining how to scan the QR code and complete the PIX transaction
- Include the email key as text alongside the QR code for manual entry

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view available subscription plans, see pricing details and features, and use a PIX QR code to make manual payments.
