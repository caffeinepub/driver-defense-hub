# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Increase the logo size in the header for better visual harmony with the overall layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase the logo dimensions in the header navigation component
- Adjust spacing and alignment to maintain visual balance with other header elements
- Ensure responsive scaling on mobile devices

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a larger, more prominent logo in the header that is better proportioned with the rest of the navigation elements.
