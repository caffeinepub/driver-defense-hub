# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a dark mode web application for drivers to calculate financial losses from trips and generate AI-powered legal defense documents for traffic violations, with PDF export functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a financial loss calculator with inputs for distance, fuel costs, tolls, maintenance, and fines that displays total loss and itemized breakdown
- Build a legal defense generator that accepts incident details (date, location, violation type, circumstances) and produces structured defense documents with legal arguments and next steps
- Implement PDF export for both calculations and defense documents with professional formatting
- Design a driver-optimized dark mode UI with high contrast, large touch targets, and warm/earth tone color scheme (avoiding blue and purple)
- Create a dashboard homepage with quick-access cards to both tools and a history of saved calculations and defenses

**User-visible outcome:** Drivers can calculate their financial losses from trips, generate legal defense documents for traffic violations, export both as PDFs, and access their history from a dark mode dashboard optimized for readability and touch interaction.
