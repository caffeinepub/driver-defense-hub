  "summary": "The diff successfully implements REQ-1 by increasing the logo size in the header from an unspecified smaller size to h-16 (mobile) and h-20 (desktop). The changes maintain proper spacing, add hover animations, and are documented in the frontend-file-summaries.txt. All acceptance criteria appear to be met: the logo is noticeably larger, maintains proportional harmony with header elements, includes proper spacing/alignment, and scales appropriately on mobile devices. No requirements are missing and no hallucinated features were detected.",
